You will need to use your Stony Brook (*.stonybrook.edu) account for coding and Google Drive to save your results.\n","\n","## Google Colab Tutorial\n","---\n","Go to https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/, you will see a tutorial named \"Welcome to Colaboratory\" file, where you can learn the basics of using google colab.\n","\n","Settings used for assignments: ***Edit -> Notebook Settings -> Runtime Type (Python 3)***.\n","\n","\n","## Using SIFT in OpenCV 3.x.x in Colab\n","---\n","The default version of OpenCV in Colab is 3.4.3. If we use SIFT method directly, typically we will get this error message:\n","\n","```\n","error: OpenCV(3.4.3) /io/opencv_contrib/modules/xfeatures2d/src/sift.cpp:1207: error: (-213:The function/feature is not implemented) This algorithm is patented and is excluded in this configuration; Set OPENCV_ENABLE_NONFREE CMake option and rebuild the library in function 'create'\n","\n","```\n","\n","One simple way to use the OpenCV in-built function `SIFT` in Colab is to switch the version to the one from 'contrib'. Below is an example of switching OpenCV version:\n","\n","1. Run the following command in one section in Colab, which has already been included in this assignment:\n","```\n","pip install opencv-contrib-python==3.4.2.16\n","```\n","2. Restart runtime by\n","```\n","Runtime -> Restart Runtime\n","```\n","\n","Then you should be able to use use `cv2.xfeatures2d.SIFT_create()` to create a SIFT object, whose functions are listed at http://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/modules/xfeatures2d/doc/nonfree_features.html\n","\n","## Some Resources\n","---\n","In addition to the tutorial document, the following resources can definitely help you in this homework:\n","- http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_feature2d/py_matcher/py_matcher.html\n","- http://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/da/df5/tutorial_py_sift_intro.html\n","- http://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/modules/xfeatures2d/doc/nonfree_features.html?highlight=sift#cv2.SIFT\n","- http://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_geometric_transformations/py_geometric_transformations.html\n","\n","\n","## Description\n","---\n","In this homework, we will examine the task of scene recognition starting with\n","very simple methods: tiny images and nearest neighbor classification, and then\n","move on to more advanced methods: bags of quantized local features and linear\n","classifiers learned by support vector machines.\n","\n","Bag of words models are a popular technique for image classification inspired by\n","models used in natural language processing. The model ignores or downplays word\n","arrangement (spatial information in the image) and classifies based on a\n","histogram of the frequency of visual words. The visual word \"vocabulary\" is\n","established by clustering a large corpus of local features. See Szeliski chapter\n","14.4.1 for more details on category recognition with quantized features. In\n","addition, 14.3.2 discusses vocabulary creation and 14.1 covers classification\n","techniques.\n","\n","For this homework you will be implementing a basic bag of words model. You will\n","classify scenes into one of 16 categories by training and testing on the 16\n","scene database (introduced in [Lazebnik et al.\n","2006](http://www.di.ens.fr/willow/pdfs/cvpr06b.pdf), although built on top of\n","previously published datasets).\n","[Lazebnik et al. 2006](http://www.di.ens.fr/willow/pdfs/cvpr06b.pdf) is a great\n","paper to read, although we will be implementing the baseline method the paper\n","discusses (equivalent to the zero level pyramid) and not the more sophisticated\n","spatial pyramid.

One simply resizes each image to a small, fixed resolution. You are required to **resize the image to 16x16**. It works slightly better if the tiny image is made to have zero mean and unit length (normalization). This is not a particularly good representation, because it discards all of the high frequency image content and is not especially invariant to spatial or brightness shifts. We are using tiny images simply as a baseline.\n","\n","The nearest neighbor classifier is equally simple to understand. When tasked with classifying a test feature into a particular category, one simply finds the \"nearest\" training example (L2 distance is a sufficient metric) and assigns the label of that nearest training example to the test example. The nearest neighbor classifier has many desirable features — it requires no training, it can learn arbitrarily complex decision boundaries, and it trivially supports multiclass problems. It is quite vulnerable to training noise, though, which can be alleviated by voting based on the K nearest neighbors (but you are not required to do so).
